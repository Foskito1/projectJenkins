# Note:
# - Insert in alphabetic order (more legible)
# - We assume the user can use the Messageformat class for formating the
#  messages, this simplify the number of such messages.
# - Don't put blanks at the end of the value (description)! there are considered in the key value.
# - Use blanks to separate the key from its value, tabs don't have the same look in all editors.
# - Indent to the maximum length among all keys.
